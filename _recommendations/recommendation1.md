I have had the pleasure of working closely with Sneha for the past couple of years at Fractal. 

Sneha is an exceptional data scientist who possesses a rare blend of technical expertise, analytical prowess, and a passion for delivering impactful insights. Throughout our collaboration, she consistently demonstrated an impressive ability to extract meaningful patterns from complex datasets, providing invaluable insights that informed our project decisions.

One of Sneha's standout qualities is her proficiency in learning, selecting and applying the right statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to solve intricate business challenges. Her willingness to keep an open mind and explore alternate solutions helped in solving complex problems in an agile manner.

In addition to her technical contributions, Sneha is an excellent team player who actively contributes to brainstorming sessions and engages in constructive discussions. Her collaborative approach and willingness to share knowledge greatly enriched the team's overall performance and created a positive working environment.

I highly recommend Sneha to any organization seeking a data scientist/analytics professional who can truly make an impact.
