This work is a part of our curriculum at University of Massachusetts, Amherst in collaboration with MAIDAP team at Microsoft. I am currently working with fellow UMass students on this project where we are developing a general framework for judging agents across domains which is scalable and computationally efficient. Let's dive into the specifics of it. Also it's a WIP so stay tuned.
